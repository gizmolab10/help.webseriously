# Moving and adding ideas

![[edit-tools.png]]

Eventually you want to move ideas around and add new ones. The organing tools are available in a circular palette (as above). It appears on a selected item when you tap the back-quote key (\`) to the left of the numeral 1 key. 

- 'x' button in the center: dismiss the palette.
- Trash can button: **delete** the item.
- Two plus buttons:
	- Right-pointing: add a **child**.
	- Left-pointing: add a **parent** and [[select]] it.
- Upward-pointing button containing a small dot is special. It becomes enabled when the [[select|selected]] item is a parent of more than one idea. Click on it to change the [[select|selection]] to the next location in the hierarchy where it is a parent (of another child). If this is confusing, I get it, and recommend ignoring this and moving on.
