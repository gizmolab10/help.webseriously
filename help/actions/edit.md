# Editing

- To **edit** a the text of an item, click on it twice. This will select all of the text. If you want to replace the entire text, just type. To alter the text instead, use the arrow keys to place the cursor and then delete or type.
- When you finish editing, tap the _Enter_ key to save your changes.

Several other kinds of editing are available. They are available in a circular palette, which I call the **editing tools**. Long click (hold down for half a second) on an item to bring it up (as illustrated above).

- Trash can: **delete** the item.
- Two plus buttons:
	- Right-pointing: add a **child**.
	- Left-pointing: select and add an additional **parent**.
- Upward-pointing: **change** selection to the same item, but **in its next parent**.
