# Graphs

Two graph layouts are currently available: tree and cluster. Both show at least the [[Focus|focus]]. They also show:
- tree: focused on one thing of interest and its progeny (sub-hierarchy)
- cluster: immediate relationships: children, parents and related things.

Every thing is shown with a drag [[Dots|dot]].
