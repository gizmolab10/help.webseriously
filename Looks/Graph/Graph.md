# Graphs

Two graph layouts are currently available: tree and cluster. Both show at least the [[Focus|focus]]. They also show:
- [[Tree|tree]]: focused on one thing of interest and its progeny (sub-hierarchy)
- [[Clusters|clusters]]: immediate relationships: children, parents and related things.

### What these two layouts have in common

Every thing is shown with a drag [[Dots|dot]]. Click on it to make it the [[Focus|focus]].
