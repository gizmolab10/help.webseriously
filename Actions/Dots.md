# Dots

	![[dots.png]]   

---
Each item in the graph has a **drag** dot on the left. In the tree graph, some items have a **reveal** dot on the right (both illustrated above).

- Click a reveal dot to **hide or reveal** the items in its list. This helps to remove distracting clutter so that you can then look at just what is relevant.
- Click on the drag dot to [[select]] an item.
- A long hold (for half a second) when you click will [[focus]] on that item.
- **Hovering** over a dot will reverse its color. This tells you that something will happen when you click on it.
