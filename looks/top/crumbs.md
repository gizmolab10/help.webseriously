# Breadcrumbs

![[crumbs.png]]  

The idea of breadcrumbs came from Hansel and Gretel, who left them behind as they explored, planning to follow them home. As your hierarchy grows, it can be easy to forget where you are at the moment. Breadcrumbs help you visualize the place where you are currently [[focus|focused]]. Left to right, they go from parent to child.

The [[focus]] is dark (Curiosity, above). The [[select|selected]] item is outlined (Aesthetics). These two breadcrumbs do nothing when you click on them. All the others can be clicked on, and this will change the focus to that idea.
