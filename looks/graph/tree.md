# Tree view

![[tree.png]] 
The tree view presents your hierarchal ideas from left to right. The idea at the left is the [[focus]]. All ideas in the tree have three parts: two [[dots]] left and right and a title in the middle. Every idea can contain a list of child ideas. Each list can be hidden by clicking on the [[dots|reveal dot]].

In the image above, the idea whose title is Aesthetics is currently [[select|selected]].
