# Welcome to Seriously

What can seriously do and why might you want to use it?

This [[start|tutorial]]  shall attempt to walk you through a first few steps and help you become familiar with and comfortable using it. A companion [[user guide]] describes each of its features.

To begin, please **visit (or revisit) this website:**

`https://webseriously.org/?db=fire&name=<your name>`

Seriously will create a brand new repository (for your private use) the first time you visit. Remember how you typed your name so you can revisit it later on another computer. On this computer, for future visits, all you need is:

[[https://webseriously.org|webseriously.org]]

This is what will appear (with your name, instead, as you spelled it):
