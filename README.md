# Welcome to Seriously

Seriously is a hierarchalÂ [[graph]] of your ideas. I've written a [[tutorial]] to gently take you through your fist steps and hopefully give you a comfortable sense of what it can do and why you might want to use it. I've also written a [[user guide]] for your reference later when you need to refresh your memory.

To follow along and try things out, you'll need to **visit (or revisit) this website:**

`https://webseriously.org/?db=firebase&name=your name`

**replacing "your name" with, yep, your name**. The first time you visit, Seriously will create a brand new repository for your private use. Remember how you typed it so you can revisit it later. This is what will appear (with your name, instead, as you spelled it):
