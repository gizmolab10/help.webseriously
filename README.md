# Welcome to Seriously

What can Seriously do and why might you want to use it?

In this [[tutorial/graph|tutorial]] I will walk you through a first few steps and help you become familiar with and comfortable using it. A companion [[user guide]] describes each of its features.

To begin, please **visit (or revisit) this website:**

`https://webseriously.org/?db=fire&name=<your name>`

Seriously will create a brand new repository (for your private use) the first time you visit. Remember how you typed your name so you can revisit it later on another computer. On this computer, for future visits, all you need is:

[webseriously.org](https://webseriously.org)

Below is an example (using my data) of what will appear.

If this looks overwhelming, the important thing to notice is the "graph" in the middle of the largest view (Life, Curious, and ...). For now, you can ignore everything else. The graph is an outline or a summary or a map. I will be calling it a graph because that's the software engineering term.
