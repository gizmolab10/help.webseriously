# Editing

- To **edit** a the text of an item, click on it twice. This will select all of the text. If you want to replace the entire text, just type. To alter the text instead, use the arrow keys to place the cursor and then delete or type.
- When you finish editing, tap the _Enter_ key to save your changes.
- Changing the graph uses different tools ([[organize|click here]]).
