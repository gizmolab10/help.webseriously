# Moving and adding ideas

![[edit-tools.png]]

Eventually you want to move ideas around and add new ones. The organizing tools for doing that are available in a circular palette. It appears on a selected item (as above) when you tap the back-quote key (\`). That key is usually located to the left of the numeral 1 key. Here is what those seven buttons do:

- 'X' button in the center: dismiss the palette.
- Trash can button: **delete** the item.
- Plus buttons:
	- Right-pointing: add a **child**.
	- Left-pointing: add a **parent** and [[select]] it.
- Minus button: deleting a parent.
- Upward-pointing button containing a small dot: browse multiple parents.
- Three-dot ellipsis: <under construction>.
