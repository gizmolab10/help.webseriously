![[edit-tools.png]]

Eventually you want to move ideas around and add new ones. The organing tools are available in a circular palette (as above). It appears on a selected item when you tap the back-quote key (\`), usually located to the left of the numeral 1 key.

- 'X' button in the center: dismiss the palette.
- Trash can button: **delete** the item.
- Plus buttons:
	- Right-pointing: add a **child**.
	- Left-pointing: add a **parent** and [[select]] it.
- Minus button: deleting a parent.
- Upward-pointing button containing a small dot: browse multiple parents.
- Three-dot ellipsis: <under construction>.
