- To **add a child** item to it (and begin editing the child), tap the _Space_ key.
- To **duplicate** an item (and begin to edit the duplicate), tap the _D_ key.
- To **delete** it, tap the _Delete_ key.
- To **move** it, hold the _Option_ key down and tap an arrow key.
- To add a **line**, tap the _Hyphen_ key.
- The buttons above the graph indicates the location of the **selected** item within the hierarchy. They are called **breadcrumbs** (like Hansel and Grettle left behind to find their way home).
