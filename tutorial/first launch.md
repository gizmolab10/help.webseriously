So, hey. We'll start out with a list. You likely make them a lot. We'll make one here.

The first time you visit webseriously, this is what you will see (with your name, of course):

The oblong at the bottom is surrounding your name, indicating that it is [[select|selected]]. We'll now make a list for it. Tap the SPACE key. This is what you will now see:

A list with one item appears. The title of this new item is "idea." It is surrounded by a dashed oblong, indicating it is waiting for you to type something. The title is selected, meaning that whatever you type first completely deletes the title, replacing it with what you type. So, type "i am here" and this is what you will see:
