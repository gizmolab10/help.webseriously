# What's a hierarchy?

Take a moment to consider how much is on your mind daily, weekly and longer term. If you're like me you might have several lists on several sheets of paper. And then I loose track of how to find the one I need. Paper is cool stuff, it folds and fits in your pocket.

Seriously, running on a computer is different than paper. All your lists can easily stay inside it. Obviously, you can move things around (without crossing out or scribbling or arrows). When a list is done delete it, no paper to recycle.

Then, hierarchies take this to a new level. Of course, a hierarchy is just an outline, with the normal indentation rules. No big whoop. Seriously adds three wrinkles:

- it looks nicer, less fussy and formal
- you can hide stuff and see only the bits you want
- an item can be in more than one list
