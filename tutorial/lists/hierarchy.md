# What's next?

Take a moment to consider how much is on your mind daily, weekly and longer term. If you're like me you might have several lists on several sheets of paper. And then I loose track of how to find the one I need. Paper is cool stuff, it folds and fits in your pocket.

Seriously, running on a computer is different than paper. All your lists can easily stay inside it. When a list is done delete it, no paper to recycle. Hierarchies take this to a new level. Of course, it's just an outline, with the normal indentation rules. No big whoop. I have two excuses for making it available for you to use:

- it looks nicer, less fussy and formal
- you can hide stuff that's not relevant
