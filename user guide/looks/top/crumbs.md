# Breadcrumbs

![[crumbs.png]]  

The idea of breadcrumbs comes from Hansel and Gretel, who left them behind as they explored, planning to follow them home. As your hierarchy grows, it can be easy to forget where you are at the moment. Breadcrumbs help you visualize the place where you are currently [[focus|focused]]. Left to right, they go from parent to child.

The [[focus]] is outlined (e.g., Life). The [[select|selected]] item is solid (e.g., Diligent). Clicking on the focus breadcrumb does nothing. Any of the other breadcrumbs can be clicked on, to make that idea become the focus.
