# Welcome to Seriously

Seriously is a hierarchal [[user guide/looks/graph/graph]] of your ideas. You can [[browse]] around, narrow your [[focus]] (hide unimportant stuff). You can [[edit]] your data in comfort and instantly see the impact.

Seriously has four areas (see below). The large area at the lower right is the [[user guide/looks/graph/graph]]. This is where you view and edit your ideas. There are two strips at the [[top]] are the [[controls]] and [[crumbs]]. [[details|Details]] are at the left.
